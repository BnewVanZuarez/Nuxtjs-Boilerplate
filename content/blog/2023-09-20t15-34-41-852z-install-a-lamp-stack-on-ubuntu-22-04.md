## What is a LAMP Stack?

The LAMP Stack is an acronym for Linux, [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/), [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/), and [PHP](https://www.php.net/). It includes an operating system, a web server, a database, and a versatile programming language. All components are available through the default Ubuntu software repositories.

The LAMP Stack is sufficient to host web applications and implement a modern computing environment. Many other Ubuntu applications rely on some or all of these programs. In some cases, substitutions to the LAMP stack can be made. For example, the NGINX web server can be used instead of Apache. Each component has a role within the software stack.

* **Linux**: Linux is an operating system based on UNIX. Linux is available for free as open source technology. There are several distinct implementations of Linux, which are known as distributions. Ubuntu is one of the most popular distributions. Other alternatives include Debian, Red Hat, Arch, and many, many others. Each distribution of Linux is associated with a software library. This library is used to install other software, including the other LAMP stack components.
* **Apache HTTP Server**: Apache is the most common web server for Ubuntu and throughout the public internet. The Apache Software Foundation develops and releases Apache as free and open source software. The standard version of Apache includes all components required to host a web site. However, extra modules can be used to add features including authentication and programming language APIs.
* **MySQL**: MySQL is a *relational database management system* (RDBMS). Although owned by Oracle, MySQL is free. Its source code is available under the GNU General Public License. MariaDB or PostgreSQL sometimes replace MySQL in the stack.
* **PHP**: PHP is the server-side scripting and programming language used in the stack. It is commonly used in web development and is firmly integrated with the rest of the stack. An Ubuntu system interprets PHP code using a PHP processor. PHP commands can be efficiently embedded within an HTML page. PHP software is available for free under the PHP License. Alternatives to PHP include Perl and Python, which can also serve as the **P** in the LAMP stack.

## Installing a LAMP Stack on Ubuntu

This section explains how to install a LAMP Stack on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. These instructions are also generally valid for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

To install the LAMP stack on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, follow these steps. In all cases, enter `y` to proceed with the installation when asked for confirmation.

1. Using `apt`, update the Ubuntu packages:

   ```command
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
   ```
2. Install the Apache web server using `apt`:

   ```command
   sudo apt install apache2
   ```
3. Install the MySQL web server:

   ```command
   sudo apt install mysql-server
   ```
4. Install PHP, along with additional PHP modules for Apache and MySQL:

   ```command
   sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
   ```
5. **(Optional)** Install the following commonly-used PHP modules. These packages add PHP support for cURL, *JavaScript Object Notation* (JSON), and the *Common Gateway Interface* (CGI).

   ```command
   sudo apt install php-curl php-json php-cgi
   ```
6. **(Optional)** To host a WordPress site on the server, install the following PHP components:

   ```command
   sudo apt install php-curl php-gd php-mbstring php-xml php-xmlrpc
   ```

### Configuring the MySQL Database

The MySQL database is ready to use as soon as it is installed. However, it is necessary to create a database user for the web application and increase application security. To finish configuring MySQL, follow these steps.

1. Log in to the MySQL shell as the `root` user. The application displays the `mysql>` prompt.

   ````
   ```command
   sudo mysql -u root
   ```

   ```command
   ````

   Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
   Your MySQL connection id is 10
   Server version: 8.0.29-0ubuntu0.22.04.2 (Ubuntu)
   ...
   Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql>
    `

2. From the MySQL shell, create the `webdata` database. Create a new user account for web application access. Provide an actual user name and password in place of `webuser` and `password` in the `CREATE USER` query. Grant full rights to the user. MySQL should respond with `Query OK` after each line.

   ```command
   CREATE DATABASE webdata;
   CREATE USER 'webuser' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   GRANT ALL ON webdata.* TO 'webuser';
   ```
3. Exit the SQL shell:

   ```command
   quit
   ```
4. The latest release of MySQL requires a root password before `mysql_secure_installation` can be used. Enter the SQL shell again using `sudo mysql` but do not provide a user.

   ```command
   sudo mysql
   ```
5. Set a password for `root'@'localhost`. Use an actual secure password instead of `password`.

   ```command
   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password by 'password';
   ```
6. Exit the SQL shell:

   ```command
   exit
   ```
7. Use the built-in [mysql_secure_installation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-secure-installation.html) tool to increase the security of the database. Provide the MySQL password for the `root` account upon request.

   ```command
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
   ```
8. When prompted to change the `root` password, leave it unchanged. But answer `Y` for the following questions:

   * `Remove anonymous users?`
   * `Disallow root login remotely?`
   * `Remove test database and access to it?`
   * `Reload privilege tables now?`

For more information on how to configure and use MySQL, see the [MySQL Reference Manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/).

## Troubleshooting the LAMP Stack Installation

Although it is fairly straightforward to install a LAMP Stack on Ubuntu, it is a lengthy process. It is easy to miss a command or incorrectly spell a variable. The easiest way to quickly find errors is to keep testing as you proceed. For instance, visit the IP address of the Ubuntu system after configuring and enabling Apache.

Here are a few things to consider if the LAMP Stack is not working.

* **Verify Apache is running**: Even if Apache was initially working, it could have stopped or failed upon a reload. Confirm it is `active` and restart it using these commands:

  ```command
  sudo systemctl status apache2
  sudo systemctl restart apache2
  ```
* **Confirm the domain name and server IP address**: If the HTTP request times out, it could be due to an incorrect address or domain name. Try the IP address first, then visit the domain name without any subdirectories or filenames. Ensure the DNS record for the domain has been set to the IP address of the Ubuntu system and the address has propagated. This can take up to one full day.
* **Confirm the user information in MySQL**: Ensure the database user has been added properly. Ensure the `webdata` database exists and the user has been granted all rights to it.
* **Review all configuration files**: Many errors are due to missing or incorrect variables in the configuration files. Ensure the `DirectoryRoot` variable in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com.conf` matches the path of the domain directory. If this variable is incorrect, the browser might display the default Apache landing page, a `404` error, or an unexpected directory list.
* **Verify the location of the test script**: The test script must be located somewhere in the `DirectoryRoot` directory. The script should also be visible in the root directory of the domain.
* **Confirm the user name and password used in the test script**: Most database connection failures in the test script are due to an incorrect server name, password, or user name. Look for missing or incorrect information in the script.
* **Review the Logs**: The error logs for PHP are located at `/var/log/php/error.log`, while domain logs can be found at `/var/www/html/example.com/logs/error.log`. Examine the contents of both files and scan them for errors.
* **Review the installation instructions**: It is easy to overlook an important step. Incorrect user permissions or an uninstalled PHP module can cause confusing failures.

## A Summary of How to Install a LAMP Stack on Ubuntu 22.04

The LAMP Stack consists of the Linux operating system, Apache web server, MYSQL RDBMS, and PHP programming language. These free and open source components power many modern web applications. The individual components are designed to work together and are easy to install and use.

The LAMP stack can be installed on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS using `apt`. After configuring the Apache web server, it is good practice to create a virtual host for the domain. To integrate the MySQL web server, create a new account to represent the web user. Additional PHP packages must be installed so Apache, PHP, and the database can communicate. The new installation can be tested using a short PHP test script that connects to the database. For more information about each LAMP Stack component, see the **More Information** section of this guide.
